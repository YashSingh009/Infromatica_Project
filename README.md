# Infromatica_Project
We used kaggle to get the Superstore.csv dataset and extract some of the records for this project.
To begin, we move data from flat to the database of the source user.
The data was then sorted by category column.
SCD TYPE1 was performed on the data of one of the categories, furniture, using the update strategy transformation.
We moved data from the remaining categories into separate target tables in simultaneously.
We also created a flat file as an output for storing some general data analysis.
